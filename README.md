# Pong

Pong is one of the first commercialized video games, produced by Atari as an arcade in 1972 and as a dedicated console in 1975. It is a ping-pong simulator, with extremely simplified black and white graphics (Wikipedia).

What I wanted to do is simply recreate it using ElectronJS technology to practice.

## How to start

You can simply install the dependencies via:

```shell
npm install
```

and run the program using:

```shell
npm run start
```

If there are no errors, a window will automatically open where you can play.

## Contributions

I accept contributions, but it would be quite useless. It's a project started randomly, as a test for me.
